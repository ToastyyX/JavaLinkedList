# Linked-List-Data-Structure

- Creation Date: July 13th, 2023

------------------

Welcome!
This is a basic implementation of the _'Linked-List'_ data structure.
After recently implementing a basic _'Array-List'_ data structure, I've now decided to move forward and study the
Linked List.
Mainly because I've heard that the Linked List is a more efficient data structure than the Array List.
But I'm more curious to see how the Linked List works under the hood. So I'm hoping that this implementation will help
me better understand the Linked List.
Along with other forms of data structures.
<br><br>My Goals: 
<ul>
    <li>Familiarity with designing and implementing a Linked List</li>
    <li>Understanding the inner workings of a Linked List</li>
    <li>Familiarity with designing methods used to manipulate a Linked List</li>
    <li>Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of a Linked List</li>
</ul>
